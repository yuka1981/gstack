## Update Check (run first)

```bash
_UPD=$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-update-check 2>/dev/null || .claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-update-check 2>/dev/null || true)
[ -n "$_UPD" ] && echo "$_UPD" || true
```

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/gstack-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined). If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell user "Running gstack v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

# Pre-Landing PR Review

You are running the `/review` workflow. Analyze the current branch's diff against main for structural issues that tests don't catch.

---

## Step 1: Check branch

1. Run `git branch --show-current` to get the current branch.
2. If on `develop`, output: **"Nothing to review — you're on develop or have no changes against develop."** and stop.
3. Run `git fetch origin develop --quiet && git diff origin/develop --stat` to check if there's a diff. If no diff, output the same message and stop.

---

## Step 2: Read the checklist

Read `.claude/skills/review/checklist.md`.

**If the file cannot be read, STOP and report the error.** Do not proceed without the checklist.

---

## Step 3: Get the diff

Fetch the latest main to avoid false positives from a stale local main:

```bash
git fetch origin develop --quiet
```

Run `git diff origin/develop` to get the full diff. This includes both committed and uncommitted changes against the latest develop.

---

## Step 4: Two-pass review

Apply the checklist against the diff in two passes:

1. **Pass 1 (CRITICAL):** SQL & Data Safety, LLM Output Trust Boundary
2. **Pass 2 (INFORMATIONAL):** Conditional Side Effects, Magic Numbers & String Coupling, Dead Code & Consistency, LLM Prompt Issues, Test Gaps, View/Frontend

Follow the output format specified in the checklist. Respect the suppressions — do NOT flag items listed in the "DO NOT flag" section.

---

## Step 5: Output findings

**Always output ALL findings** — both critical and informational. The user must see every issue.

- If CRITICAL issues found: output all findings, then for EACH critical issue use a separate AskUserQuestion with the problem, your recommended fix, and options (A: Fix it now, B: Acknowledge, C: False positive — skip).
  After all critical questions are answered, output a summary of what the user chose for each issue. If the user chose A (fix) on any issue, apply the recommended fixes. If only B/C were chosen, no action needed.
- If only non-critical issues found: output findings. No further action needed.
- If no issues found: output `Pre-Landing Review: No issues found.`

---

## Step 5.5: TODOS cross-reference

Read `TODOS.md` in the repository root (if it exists). Cross-reference the PR against open TODOs:

- **Does this PR close any open TODOs?** If yes, note which items in your output: "This PR addresses TODO: <title>"
- **Does this PR create work that should become a TODO?** If yes, flag it as an informational finding.
- **Are there related TODOs that provide context for this review?** If yes, reference them when discussing related findings.

If TODOS.md doesn't exist, skip this step silently.

---

## Important Rules

- **Read the FULL diff before commenting.** Do not flag issues already addressed in the diff.
- **Read-only by default.** Only modify files if the user explicitly chooses "Fix it now" on a critical issue. Never commit, push, or create PRs.
- **Be terse.** One line problem, one line fix. No preamble.
- **Only flag real problems.** Skip anything that's fine.
